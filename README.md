### Hi there 👋

![snake gif](https://github.com/Julenasti/Julenasti/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif)

I'm Julen, an ecologist studying global change impacts on forest dynamics at the University of Alcalá (Madrid) 🌳 * 🌤️
I mainly work with forest inventory and climate data 📈
I also love going into the field and spending time observing nature and collecting data to try to understand the natural history of ecosystems ⛰️
I don't like repetitive task and that's why I'm a big fan of coding (mainly R) 👨‍💻
Apart from science, I'm currently having fun working on some cool R packages related to climate data and dendrochronology 📦
