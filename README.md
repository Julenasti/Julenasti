### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Julen, an ecologist studying the impacts of global change on forest dynamics at the University of the Basque Country and Lund University 🌳🌤️. 
I work at the intersection of ecology and data science 🌳👨‍💻. I love getting into the field to understand the natural history of ecosystems or simply for fun ⛰️. I don't like repetitive task and I like problem-solving games, that's why I'm a big fan of coding (mainly R) 👨‍💻.
I believe that knowledge and science should be open to everyone and approached slowly, with time to think and enjoy the learning process. Here are some projects and courses I've been involved in that might be useful, with information available mainly in Spanish and sometimes in English:
- Explore the ecoinformatics notes, seminars, and more from the [Ecoinformatics group of the Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology](https://ecoinfaeet.github.io/website/index.html)
- Understand [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/Julenasti/intro_git-github)
- Learn about [Functional Programming](https://github.com/Julenasti/intro_prog_fun)
- Discover the potential of [Data Science in R](https://github.com/DatSciR/ciencia_datos)
- Download climate data from [easyclimate](https://github.com/VeruGHub/easyclimate)
- Publications: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julen-Astigarraga
