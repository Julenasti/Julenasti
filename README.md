### Hi there 👋

![snake gif](https://github.com/Julenasti/Julenasti/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif)

I'm Julen a PhD student at the University of Alcalá studying climate change impacts on forests 🌳 * 🌤️
I mainly work with forest inventory data 📈, but I also love to go to the field and see what the trees can tell us. That's why I like dendrochronology 💍
I don't like repetitive task so I'm a big fan of coding (mainly R) 👨‍💻
Apart from my PhD I'm currently having fun working on some cool R packages related to climate data and dendrochronology 📦
