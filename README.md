### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Julen, an ecologist studying the impacts of global change on forest dynamics at the University of Alcalá (Madrid) 🌳🌤️. 
I primarily work as a computational ecologist, at the intersection of ecology and data science 🌳👨‍💻. However, I also love getting into the field to understand the natural history of ecosystems or just for fun ⛰️.
I don't like repetitive task and I like solving puzzles, that's why I'm a big fan of coding (mainly in R) 👨‍💻.
I believe that knowledge should be open to everyone and here are some projects and courses I've been involved in that might be useful, with information available mainly in Spanish and sometimes in English:
- Explore the ecoinformatics notes, seminars, and more from the [Ecoinformatics group of the Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology](https://ecoinfaeet.github.io/website/index.html)
- Download climate data from [easyclimate](https://github.com/VeruGHub/easyclimate)
- Understand [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/Julenasti/intro_git-github)
- Learn about [Functional Programming](https://github.com/Julenasti/intro_prog_fun)
